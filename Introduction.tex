In this thesis we are going to classify division algebras, and in a related fashion, classify which spheres can be groups. The classification of division algebras will be done in 3 phases. First we will classify the associative division algebras. Then we will classify the composition algebras. In order to classify all the division algebras we will show that if $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a division algebra then $S^{n-1}$ is a Hopf space. And then we will show that $S^{n-1}$ is a Hopf space if and only if $n = 1,2,4,8$. This allows us to classify the division algebras. For this thesis we first study division algebras and follow the proofs stated in \cite{Frob} for the Frobenius theorem. Then we will take a closer look at composition algebras and follow \cite{Hurwitz} closely. Then from the introduction of vector bundles and onwards we closely follow \cite{VBKT}. There are extra references to more background information. See for example \cite{Adams}.
\section{Preliminary knowledge}
We will assume that the reader has understanding of introduction to topology, for example in \cite{topo} and group theory, and hence we assume the reader knows the following concepts: spheres, real numbers, complex numbers and quaternions. Further more we assume the reader has background in algebraic topology as on the level of \cite{AG}
