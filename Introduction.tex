In this thesis we are going to do classify division algebras, and in a related fashion, classify which spheres can be groups. The classification of division algebras will be done in 3 phases. First we will classify the associative division algebras. Then we will classify the composition algebras. In order to classify all the division algebras we will show that if $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a division algebra then $S^{n-1}$ is a Hopf space. And then we will show that $S^{n-1}$ is a hopf space if and only if $n = 1,2,4,8$. This allows us to classify the division algebras.
\section{Preliminary knowledge}
We will assume that the reader has understanding of introduction to topology and group theory, and hence we assume the reader knows the following conceps: spheres, real numbers, complex numbers and quaternions.
